The simulated datasets are generated by splatter package.

# Usage

1. Clone this project
```
git clone https://github.com/labiip/scDBImpute
cd scDBImpute
```

2. Train the model
```
clear;
clc;
run main.m
```

3. The downstream analysis
```
run cluster.R
run DEanalysis.R
run trajectory.R
```

The SC3 package was downloaded from R Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SC3.html).
The edgeR package was downloaded from R Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html).
The Monocle 2 package was downloaded from the R Bioconductor page (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/monocle.html). 
To ensure consistency with other tools, the gene filtering option is turned off (gene.filter =FALSE). Other options are set to default values.
